      "Scrub the potatoes thoroughly under running water to remove all dirt. Do not peel them; the skin adds texture and flavor.",
      "Using a mandolin slicer, cut the potatoes into very thin, even slices to ensure uniform cooking.",
      "Place the slices in a bowl of water and rinse 2–3 times until the water runs mostly clear. This removes excess starch and helps achieve crisp chips.",

      "Lightly grease a microwave-safe plate or line it with parchment paper.",
      "Arrange the potato slices in a single, non-overlapping layer. Avoid stacking to ensure even cooking.",
      "Microwave on high power for 5–8 minutes, checking every 2 minutes. Rotate the plate and flip or rearrange slices as needed. Stop cooking as soon as the chips turn lightly golden and crisp — overcooking can cause burning, especially in the center.",
      "Remove from the microwave and let the chips rest for 1–2 minutes. They will continue to crisp as they cool.",
